## About
Location and time are dimensions that bind information together.

GeoPrism Registry uses semantic technologies to enable data and information from multiple organizations to be properly contextualized in both space and time to support geographically based planning, decision making, cooperation and coordination among agencies of federal governments, local governments, non-profits, and the private sector. Collaboration across sectors is needed to promote public health, economic development, environmental protection, flood zone research, disaster recovery, education, agriculture, infrastructure, and other public and private services.

## GeoPrism Registry as a CGR

GeoPrism Registry is an open-source Common Geo-Registry (CGR) implementation that utilizes spatial knowledge graphs to provide a single source of truth for managing geographic data over time across multiple organizations and information systems. It is used to host, manage, regularly update and share lists, associated hierarchies, and geospatial data through time for geographic objects core to spatial data infrastructure, sustainable development, and public health (e.g., administrative divisions, settlements, health facilities, schools, and other relevant physical and non-physical geographic features). 

The [CGR vision specification](https://healthgeolab.net/DOCUMENTS/Guidance_Common_Geo-registry_Ve2.pdf) is a long term vision of Health GeoLab Collaborative. The GeoPrism Registry implementation is developed in partnership with Health GeoLab Collaborative, Clinton Health Access Initiative, Vital Wave, and other Digital Solutions For Malaria Elimination (DSME) community partners.

# Enables geospatial initiatives and infrastructures

## [Integrated Geographic Information Framework (IGIF)](https://ggim.un.org/IGIF/)

At the technical level, GeoPrism Registry contributes to the standards strategic pathway of the
IGIF by supporting data interoperability.

## [Global Statistical Geospatial Framework (GSGF)](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/51st-session/documents/The_GSGF-E.pdf)

GeoPrism Registry supports the operationalization of the first three principles of the GSGF: 1.
Use of fundamental geospatial infrastructure and geocoding; 2. Geocoded unit record data in a
data management environment; 3. Common geographies for the dissemination of statistics.

## [Geospatial Knowledge Infrastructure (GKI)](https://geospatialmedia.net/pdf/GKI-White-Paper.pdf)

GeoPrism Registry aligns with the GKI concept by helping to place geospatial knowledge at the
center of tomorrowâ€™s sustainable digital society.


## Health Information Exchange (HIE)

GeoPrism Registry strengthens HIEs and
disease intervention programs by enabling
data interoperability across health information
systems using common geographies and
managing multiple organizational hierarchies
and relationships between locations as they
change over time, which is essential for
microplanning and trend analysis. GeoPrism
Registry is interoperable with DHIS2, Global
Open Facility Registry (GOFR), supports Fast
Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR),
Reveal, and supports a RESTful API.


## National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NDSI)

GeoPrism Registry supports the
operationalization of the National Spatial Data
Infrastructure (NSDI) to host, manage, regularly
update and share the lists, hierarchies and spatial
data needed to properly contextualize any data
or information attached to the geographic
objects core while respecting the curation
mandate of the organizations officially in charge
of this data and information.

## Sustainable Development Goals

GePrism Registry helps address the geographic
dimension of the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDG) by providing a common geography
to support cross sectoral planning and
decision making.

## Open Source

GeoPrism Registry has been released under the
Lesser General Public License (LGPL) and was
developed using only open-source components
including OpenJDK, MapboxGL, PostgreSQL,
OrientDB, Solr, GDAL, and GeoServer. GeoPrism
Registry can be deployed in the cloud or on
premises.
