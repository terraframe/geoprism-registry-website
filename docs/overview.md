# Capabilities

GeoPrism Registry provides a unique set of data management capabilities to enable the
contextualisation of data from different sources in both space and time, facilitate trend analysis,
aggregate data according to different hierarchies, use geographic objects as the common link
between data sources and support the creation of GIS-based applications and maps based on a
common geography.

## Multiple Hierarchy Management

GeoPrism Registry provides a multi-
organization environment that supports data
governance among these organizations. At the
same time, it manages data dependencies
between organizations. Data are curated by
the organization with the authoritative
mandate and updates are automatically
propagated to other organizations that
reference them.

## Change Over Time

GeoPrism Registry tracks attributes,
geometries, and relationships (including
hierarchies) between geographic objects as
they change over time. Historical views of data
can be generated for any point or period in
time depending on the considered geographic
object type.

## Integraging Official and Unofficial Data

Data curated by official and unofficial groups
can be harmonized to create a more complete
picture of available data.

## Accessibility

Each organization can decide if the content
they are managing is to be accessed outside of
their organization or not. Lists and geospatial
data can be published for different periods of
time or dates based on a given frequency.
Historical versions are maintained for
reference.

## Historical Events

GeoPrism Registry allows capturing the
necessary information to rebuild how specific
geographic objects like administrative units
have evolved through time by being splitted
merged, upgraded or downgraded. This
information presents an accurate historical
picture key to conduct trend analysis.

## Updating Mechanism

GeoPrism Registry allows the operationalization of
the updating mechanism associated with each
geographic object it covers by providing a change
management workflow that allows authorized
users to submit change requests for approval.
